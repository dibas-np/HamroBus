                < p > In the 21 st century, everyone has a mobile phone in their hand and the internet.Everything people
                need is available on the internet.To utilize the growth of the technology we need to adapt to the
                current technology.Currently, in the context of Nepal people still use the traditional method
                for ticket booking.They go to the counter, pay cash, and then buy the ticket.There is always a crowd
                around the counter and a big queue.It’ s not because they do not know how to use technology.It’ s
                    because people do not trust the online ticket booking system.People are always afraid they will be
                    scammed.We need to change people’ s perspectives.In the current scenario, there are not many
                dedicated companies that work on the online bus ticket booking system.Many online payment
                companies like eSewa, Khalti, etc.have integrated bus ticket booking in their system but it is
                always neglected.If anyone wants to book a ticket, they need to have a verified account in their
                system and load money then they can buy the ticket.This is not convenient
                for everyone.
